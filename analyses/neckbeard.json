  "summary": "Neckbeard.py is a tool designed for assessing Python GitHub repositories by evaluating them based on fundamental software practices. It analyzes a repository's code and structure to produce a high-level review and score, focusing exclusively on the software's applicability for real-world use, rather than its theoretical or research value. The tool relies on a variety of metrics, from package setup and code complexity to test coverage and dependency analysis, running in a Docker-based environment.",
