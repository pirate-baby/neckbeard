  "summary": "Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework for Python that facilitates quick and easy project initialization while allowing scalability for more complex applications. It serves as a simple wrapper over Werkzeug and Jinja, giving developers the flexibility to choose their own tools and libraries. Flask's popularity is bolstered by community-provided extensions and its support for various functionalities like background tasks with Celery and integrating JavaScript Ajax for interaction.",
