Neckbeard.py is a handy tool for cutting through the hype of AI projects on GitHub. It’s all about quickly sniffing out the legit repos from the ones that overpromise. Despite having a tiny codebase and not many commits, it's cleverly designed to be useful and adaptable for various tasks.

It breaks down software quality metrics without being a headache to use. With insights into dependencies, code complexity, and project setup, you get an audit-style overview at a glance.

But watch out—there's zero testing going on here, which leaves some doubt about how well it performs under different conditions. Adding test suites and continuous integration would make it more reliable. Despite this, its clean implementation speaks volumes.

Neckbeard is a must-have for anyone who wants to sift through AI repos with a no-nonsense attitude.
