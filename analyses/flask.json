  "summary": "Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework designed for quick and easy startup, with the flexibility to scale to more complex applications. It originated as a simple wrapper around Werkzeug and Jinja and has evolved into one of the most popular Python frameworks, offering suggestions without enforcing dependencies or project layouts. Flask supports extensions for additional functionality and includes examples for integrating with tools like Celery and creating interactive JavaScript applications.",
