# Phidata: Streamline Your Multi-Modal Agent Deployment

Phidata aims to simplify the creation and management of advanced multi-modal agents. It offers memory, knowledge, and reasoning features in a user-friendly interface, making it easier to build intelligent agent teams.

## Code Metrics

Phidata's codebase is light at 76MB, with a package size of 123.5MB over 2,034 files. With 10 immediate and 61 total dependencies, it's organized but might be a hassle for those wary of dependency bloat. Its shallow codebase (max depth 5, average depth 1.06) suggests solid design, and there are no parsing errors—always a plus. It keeps complexity in check with an average function complexity of 5.89, maxing out at 49, and only 2.63% of functions are overly complex. However, only 111 tests raise coverage concerns for its advanced features.

## Concerns

Phidata's high number of dependencies could be a chore to manage. The current unit tests are inadequate for ensuring stable complex multi-agent orchestration. More testing would boost reliability.

## Conclusion

Phidata is a decent pick for developers moving into multi-agent systems. It’s organized and relatively low on errors, but it needs more extensive testing to back up its promises. If you're keen on building smart agent teams, it's worth a look—but keep an eye on those tests and dependencies.
