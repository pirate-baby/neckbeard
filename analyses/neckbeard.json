  "summary": "Neckbeard.py is a tool designed to evaluate Python projects by analyzing their software quality and readiness, beyond just the hype often associated with AI-related repos. It uses a combination of automated metrics and analysis techniques to score repositories on aspects like codebase size, package complexity, and test coverage. The project encapsulates these evaluations in a docker-based runtime and offers a high-level overview of the software's viability for practical use.",
