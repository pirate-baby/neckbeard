# When Complexity Meets Collaboration

CrewAI aims to coordinate autonomous AI agents for collaborative tasks, but it's a bit too complex right now. The codebase ballooned to 23344 files and 904.5 MB, making it hard to maintain. With 22 immediate dependencies and 291 total, it's relying on a lot, which could lead to update issues and compatibility problems.

The complexity is clearâ€”pyflakes can't even analyze it without running into infinite recursion. There's a mean complexity score of 4.87, and maxing out at 438 shows it could use some simplification.

On the upside, CrewAI has cool tools for managing multi-agent AI systems with role-based designs. It's ideal for developers working on smart assistants or automated customer service.

But the complexity overshadows the innovation. For those willing to dig deep, there's potential. However, to really shine, CrewAI needs to simplify and streamline dependencies.
