  "summary": "The \"LLM based Multi-Agent\" project offers a streamlined implementation of advanced methods for integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with multi-agent systems. It includes techniques such as Autonomous Iteration of Thought (AIoT) and Guided Iteration of Thought (GIoT), enabling dynamic and thorough exploration of reasoning processes. The repository provides modular and user-friendly tools suitable for experimentation and contains experimental results for the \"Iteration of Thought\" paper.",
