Promptic is a simple answer to a simple question: "How can I abstract prompting and response cohersion?" the library does what it sets out to do with a minimal immediate dependency chain and low-to-reasonable frame depths across the project code. Test coverage is somewhere between good and great. Code complexity is solidly better than average. The biggest concern with Promptic is the heavy downstream dependency chain, indicating one of the immediate deps may be bloated. In Python _"You are what you import"_, so this could be a concern. Overall Promptic is better-than-class for the current crop of oss prompt libraries.
