# RetroLLM: Whitepapers are not software

RetroLLM is an idea, written in a git repository with some scratch code attached. There is nothing wrong with that - this is how Data Scientists communicate experiments in 2024, and more power to them. But software, this is not. To call it a "framework...for training large language models" (per TLDR AI) is exaggerated at best, deceptive otherwise. This repo is effectively a post-it note reminder to build software based on a concept. As such RetroLLM scores a big fat 0 in the Neckbeard project review - because it is _not a project_.
