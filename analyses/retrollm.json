  "summary": "RetroLLM is a framework designed to improve Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by integrating retrieval and generation into a single auto-regressive decoding process. It employs hierarchical FM-Index constraints for evidence generation, allowing large language models to generate precise evidence directly from a corpus while reducing input token usage. The project includes setup instructions for building the necessary environment and FM-Index module, and supports training and evaluating on several datasets like Natural Questions and TriviaQA.",
