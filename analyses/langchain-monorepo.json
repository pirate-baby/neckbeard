  "summary": "LangChain is a Python framework designed to facilitate the development of applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It provides comprehensive tools for building context-aware reasoning applications, including open-source libraries for various components and integrations, as well as a unified platform\u2014LangSmith\u2014for building, testing, and monitoring LLM applications. The framework supports key functionalities such as context-based question answering, structured output extraction, and chatbot creation. LangChain emphasizes productionization, enabling app inspection, monitoring, and deployment, while offering an ecosystem of components like LangGraph for creating stateful multi-actor applications.",
